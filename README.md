# Cat vs. Dog Classification Enhanced by SRGAN

## Introduction
This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at binary classification of images to distinguish between cats and dogs. The project leverages a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) to enhance low-resolution images before classification, based on the SRGAN paper by Ledig et al. which can be accessed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802).

The primary objective is to assess the impact of image resolution on the performance of a binary classifier. We first train a classifier on high-resolution images, then apply SRGAN to upscale low-resolution images, and retrain the classifier on the enhanced dataset to compare performances.

## Usage
To replicate the project or use the code for your own classification tasks:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the Kaggle dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) and place it in the `cat_vs_dog_dataset` directory.
3. Use `train.py` to train the initial binary classification model on the original dataset.
4. Train the SRGAN model using the scripts in the `srgan` directory to upscale low-resolution images.
5. Generate a new dataset of enhanced images using the trained SRGAN.
6. Retrain the binary classification model using `train.py` on the new, enhanced dataset.
7. Evaluate the performance of both models using `test.py`.

## Results
The expected outcome is a detailed comparison between the classifier's performance on the original high-resolution dataset and the SRGAN-enhanced dataset. This will shed light on the effectiveness of super-resolution techniques in improving the accuracy of image classification models.
